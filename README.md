# ptouch

ptouch is a command line tool to print labels on Brother P-Touch
printers on Linux.

There is no need to install the printer via CUPS, the printer is accessed
directly via libusb.

The tool was written for and tested with the `PT-2430PC`, but it should also
work with the `PT-1230PC` (untested so far). Maybe others work too (please report USB VID and PID so I can include support for further models, too).

**Models in `libptouch.c` include:**

- PT-2420PC
- PT-1230PC
- PT-2430PC
- PT-2730
- PT-2730
- PT-P700 ( see note below about mode switch )
- PT-D450

**Further info can be found at:**

### Compile instructions:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make


### PT-P700:

- As the PT-P700 does not have a toggle switch for the printer mode, you may need to switch the mode first
- If you plug in the PT-P700 and the green light above the PLite button is on, the printer won't be recognized by `ptouch`. You must hold down the PLite button for ~ 2 seconds and the light will turn off and the system will find the device again.
- This step allowed it to be detected as `vid 0x04F9 pid 0x2061` insetad of `vid 0x04F9 pid 0x2064`
- This allows it to be found, (eg: `./ptouch-print --info`) and also puts it into a mode that it can be interfaced with


### A Note from Dominic's website

"Dear visitor, currently I have absolutely no time for improvements on this project (my free time currently is about one or two hours PER MONTH)..."

### Collaboration

You may still, of course, contact Dominic directly if you'd like. But I think GitHub is easier for collaboration, and he has given me permission to host a clone of his repo here, passing code contributions back to him.
